# Machine Learning Fundamentals

[Course](http://ama.liglab.fr/~amini/Cours/ML/) on Machine Learning Fundamentals from the Master of Science in Industrial and Applied Mathematics. Course is purely theoretical and conceptual. Grade was distributed as fallows: 30% homeworks and 70% exam. Both homeworks and exam were theoretical, without practical implementation. The topics of homeworks are:

* HW1 - Convergence of the Perceptorn algorithm
* HW2 - Convergence of the Margin-based Perceptorn Algorithm
* HW3 - COnvergence of the PEGASOS (Primal Estimated sub-Gradient SOlver for SVM) Algorithm
